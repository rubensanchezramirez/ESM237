```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
The first step is to read in some data. Here, I've chosen the Lake Cachuma station from the National Centers for Environmental Information website:
https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datatools/findstation

This is the same dataset used for the trends demo in the last class session. Let's read in the data again!

```{r readdata}
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(chron)
setwd("~/Box Sync/Courses_UCSB/ESM237_Spring2021/")

clim = read.table("CachumaLake_NCDC_USC00041253_apr2021.csv",fill=TRUE,sep=',',header=T)
head(clim)

date=as.Date(clim$DATE)


```

We already looked at the behavior of trends in some metrics - but here are a couple other examples of useful extremes.

1) Number of freezing days: select all days with temperatures below 32F

```{r other metrics, echo=TRUE}

clim$freeze = ifelse(clim$TMIN <= 32, 1, 0)
clim.pk = clim %>% group_by(year(date)) %>% summarize(ndayfr=sum(freeze))
clim.pk$dt = unique(year(date))

ggplot(clim.pk, aes(dt, ndayfr))+geom_point()+labs(y="Number of Freezing Days")
```

Note that the trends in mean-state and extreme metrics often go together: from last time, recall that there was a trend toward decreasing minimum daily temperature. How does that affect the frequency of occurrence of freezing days?


2) Hottest day of the year

Looking at the warm end of the temperature distribution, we can look for trends in the temperature during the hottest day of the year.

```
clim.pk = clim %>% group_by(year(date)) %>% summarize(hotday=max(TMAX))
clim.pk$dt = unique(year(date))

ggplot(clim.pk, aes(dt, hotday))+geom_point()+labs(y="Hottest Day in the Year")
```

3) Return periods 

In lecture, we discussed the concept of return periods and return levels. Here is how you calculate these things with real data!

Calculate the return period of 1 in daily precipitation

``` {r return period}
clim$flood = ifelse(clim$PRCP >= 1, 1, 0)
nyrs=length(unique(year(date)))

retper=(nyrs+1)/sum(clim$flood,na.rm=TRUE)
```

(note: return *levels* are somewhat more complicated to calculate, since they require fitting the underlying distribution of the data... there are lots of resources out there if you need them though!)
